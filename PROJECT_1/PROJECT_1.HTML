            <h3>Lundon</h3>
            <p>I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air — or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained.
                ~ Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</p>

                    <h3>Island</h3>
                    <p>Some islands, such as the Aleutian Islands in the U.S. state of Alaska, are cold and ice-covered all year. Others, such as Tahiti, lie in warm, tropical waters. Many islands, such as Easter Island in the South Pacific Ocean, are thousands of kilometers from the nearest mainland. Other islands, such as the Greek islands known as the Cyclades in the Aegean Sea, are found in closely spaced groups called archipelagoes</p>

                    <h3>Beache</h3>
                    <p>Better known as Tiger Beach, Kakolem Beach is one of the lesser-known beaches of Goa that is perfectly hidden away from the list of popular beaches in Goa for vacation. The offbeat beach in Goa is perfectly deserted and ideal for those who wish to explore serene and quiet terrains of the beach state of India. It is clean and can only be accessed from Cola village or if you take a boat to reach it. The way to Tiger Beach is a little touch, but once you're here, you will be grateful for the journey as the destination is most certainly alluring. They also have some quaint and eco-friendly resorts to reside in as you reach Cola village.

                    <h3>Natural Areas,</h3>
                    <p>“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines, sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” ― Mark Twain</p>

                    <h3>Travel</h3>
                    <p>“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime.” – Mark Twain</p>
